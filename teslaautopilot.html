    <h1>Tesla Autopilot</h1>
    <p>
      -Tesla Autopilot is a suite of advanced driver-assistance system features offered by Tesla that has lane centering, traffic-aware cruise control, self-parking, automatic lane changes, semi-autonomous navigation on limited access freeways, and the ability to summon the car from a garage or parking spot.<br>
      -In all of these features, the driver is responsible and the car requires constant supervision.<br>
      -The company claims the features reduce accidents caused by driver negligence and fatigue from long-term driving.<br>
      -Consumer Reports called Tesla Autopilot "a distant second" (behind Cadillac's Super Cruise) in 2020, though it was ranked first in the "Capabilities and Performance" sub-category.<br>
      -As an upgrade to the base Autopilot capabilities, the company's stated intent is to offer full self-driving (FSD) at a future time, acknowledging that legal, regulatory, and technical hurdles must be overcome to achieve this goal.<br>
      -As of April 2020, most experts believe that Tesla vehicles lack the necessary hardware for full self-driving.<br>
      -Tesla was ranked last by Navigant Research in 2020 for both strategy and execution in the autonomous driving sector.

      -In 2016, data after 47 million miles of driving in Autopilot mode showed the probability of an accident was at least 50% lower when using Autopilot.<br>
